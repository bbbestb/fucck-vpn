            "reviewBody": "Ivacy \u2014 a Singapore-based VPN released in 2007 \u2014 claims to be a top-of-the-line, extremely fast, and innovative VPN. The real question is: is Ivacy worth your investment or are there better VPNs out there? With over 5,700 servers in 100 countries, Ivacy allows you to stream Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Disney+, and HBO Max, but I couldn\u2019t get it to work with Hulu. This VPN offers a zero logs policy, AES-256 encryption, split tunneling, 10 simultaneous connections, P2P servers, IPv6 leak protection, and a kill switch. Your IP address, browsing history, and personal information are completely safe and never tracked. The only information Ivacy keeps is your email address for billing purposes, and even then, you can request it to be deleted. It offers a few protocols to choose from: L2TP, OpenVPN, and IKEv2 \u2014 but no WireGuard. They also have a few protocols to choose from: L2TP, OpenVPN, and IKEv2. But, they don\u2019t support WireGuard. There\u2019s an ad and malware blocker that stops malicious sites from infecting your device, too. Ivacy claims to have fast, low-latency servers (and dedicated P2P servers). But, its slow speeds make gaming and streaming more frustrating than enjoyable. Even on a local server, Ivacy cut my speed in half. Because of this, I recommend trying a faster VPN. There are apps for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Chrome, Kodi, game consoles, and routers. They also have a free version of the app called Ivacy Lite \u2014 but it\u2019s very barebones and isn\u2019t useful. When you sign up, you get a 1-day free trial to test Ivacy anyway (and Ivacy premium is affordable). I have taken the time to test Ivacy to see how it works, if support is responsive, what features are available, how much it costs, where it\u2019s available, and if it\u2019s private and secure. Try Ivacy VPN Today! Short on Time? Here Are My Key Findings Based in Singapore and founded in 2007. This country has been known to cooperate with the 5\/9\/14 Eyes Alliance and sometimes spy on its residents, so it&#039;s not a great location for a VPN. You can read my full analysis below. Unblocks a variety of streaming sites. Ivacy unblocks Netflix US, BBC iPlayer, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video. Unfortunately, I was unable to unblock Hulu. Take a look at my streaming tests for the full report. It has apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, Chrome, Kodi, gaming consoles, and routers. Plus, there are step-by-step guides for quick and easy setup. I\u2019ll walk you through the setup process below. Ivacy is affordable and offers some great discounts. There\u2019s also a 30- day money-back guarantee and a 1-day trial. I\u2019ll talk more about their pricing structure further down. It\u2019s slow.\u00a0Even connecting to local servers, speeds were significantly impacted, with foreign servers being much worse. You can find out more from my extensive speed tests. Customer support is easily accessible. You can contact them via live chat or email, and they were responsive when I communicated with them. Ivacy is secure. It uses military-grade 256-bit encryption, a zero log policy, a kill switch, leak protection, and split tunneling. It lets you choose between L2TP, OpenVPN, and IKEv2, but doesn&#039;t support WireGuard. Its also been audited by a third party. I give a full run-down of its security and privacy below. Try Ivacy VPN Today! Ivacy VPN Features \u2014 Updated in February 2022 7.8 &amp;#x1F4B8 Price 1.99USD\/month &amp;#x1F4C6 Money Back Guarantee 30 &amp;#x1F4DD Does VPN keep logs? No &amp;#x1F5A5 Number of servers 5700 &amp;#x1F4BB Number of devices per license 10 &amp;#x1F6E1 Kill switch Yes &amp;#x1F5FA Based in country Singapore &amp;#x1F6E0 Support 24\/7 Live Chat Support &amp;#x1F4E5 Supports torrenting Yes Streaming \u2014 Unblocks Netflix US, Disney+, HBO Max, and Others Ivacy unblocked almost all of the streaming services I tested, including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video. Unfortunately, it couldn\u2019t unblock Hulu. Unblocked: Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video Using the Android app, under the Purposes tab, I found the Smart Streaming section. This lead me to a page with a list of dedicated streaming servers for HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix US, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video US, and more. I chose Netflix and was sent to the connection page, where it asked if I would like to watch Netflix. After choosing \u2018yes,\u2019 the Netflix app was opened on my phone, and I jumped right into streaming. I was able to unblock Netflix easily with Ivacy The whole process of using the Ivacy app was pretty easy and self-explanatory. I also unblocked HBO Max and Amazon Prime Video using the same method. It was also easy to unblock Amazon Prime Video and HBO Max Disney+ was a little different because the Ivacy app doesn\u2019t have a dedicated server for it, so I had to test a little differently. First, I used Ivacy\u2019s \u2018Smart Connect\u2019 feature to connect to my closest and fastest server. Once that was done, I went to my Disney+ app and signed in. It worked! I tried to test BBC iPlayer using Ivacy\u2019s dedicated streaming server in the Smart Streaming section, but didn\u2019t have any luck. I reached out to Ivacy\u2019s customer support to see what exactly was going on. Support asked what device I was using and then sent me a step-by-step guide on how to connect using the \u201cSmart Streaming\u201d option. When I explained that is how I had attempted to connect to BBC iPlayer, I was instructed to switch between security protocols in the app settings. I changed the protocol from UDP to TCP and tried again via Ivacy\u2019s Smart Streaming option, and I was in! Ivacy unblocked BBC iPlayer, but I had to change my settings first Every show I watched with Ivacy had buffering problems, taking close to a minute to load. The whole experience of streaming was slightly annoying because of this. Blocked by: Hulu Hulu, on the other hand, was unsuccessful. I reconnected to the VPN three times, hoping that a change in IP address would resolve the issue, but it didn\u2019t. I also tried to use the Chrome and Firefox extensions to see if they could unblock it but they were so slow I couldn\u2019t load the pages. I contacted their live customer support about this issue. According to Ivacy, other users have reported the same issue. Support confirmed that Ivacy can\u2019t unblock Hulu Streaming services like Hulu and Netflix try to stay on top of blocking VPNs, so considering only one was blocked out of the handful I tested, this isn\u2019t a bad outcome. Unblock Netflix With Ivacy! Speeds \u2014 Slashes Speed While Ivacy advertises exceptional speeds, I was far from impressed. I attempted to test Ivacy&#039;s Chrome and Firefox extensions on my laptop, but my speeds dropped so dramatically that webpages wouldn\u2019t open. I connected on my Android, where I had better luck. It took between 10-30 seconds to connect. My speed was decent on local servers, but I had significant drops on overseas servers. If you don&#039;t have the best connection initially, Ivacy will not help. I tested several locations using OpenVPN (the only protocol available on the app). It\u2019s disappointing that Ivacy doesn\u2019t have WireGuard like most top VPNs do. WireGuard is faster than OpenVPN and this would help with speed tremendously. Location Download Speed (Mbps) Upload speed (Mbps) Ping (ms) Speed loss % Alabama, US (starting speed) 34.20 5.70 29 N\/A Georgia, US 18.00 1.48 54 47.37% London, UK 7.97 6.90 141 76.70% Paris, FR 13.40 11.30 191 60.80% Queensland, AU 11.00 4.95 262 67.80% Frankfurt, Germany 1.18 9.39 201 96.50% Singapore 10.50 13.40 281 69.20% Ultimately, your location and distance from the server determines whether you get a decent connection. Still, when I connected to my local server here in the US, my speed dropped by a lot. French and Australian servers were better, but the speeds were awful in general. Germany by far was the worst. Try Ivacy VPN Today! Are Ivacy&#039;s Speeds Fast Enough for Gaming? Maybe Using the Smart Connect feature will give you the best gaming results, but ultimately speed reduction is inevitable with Ivacy. Ivacy claims to have a decent latency rate, but from personal experience, their claims fall short. Latency on my local server was 54ms \u2014 which is pushing it, considering a decent ping rate for gaming, on average, is 40-60ms. I wasn\u2019t even able to test properly due to Ivacy making everything extremely glitchy while in use. Try Ivacy VPN Today! Server Network \u2014 Plenty of Servers Ivacy has 5,700 servers in 100 locations. This seems like a good setup because you will have a wide variety of options, but we need to dive into this a little further. Having a lot of servers looks excellent on the surface, but we need to look at the number of servers in one country vs. the number of users in that country. You&#039;re going to have an easier time accessing a country with 100 servers than a country with only 10. And, if the country you want to connect to is overcrowded because there are too few servers, your speed will drop. Think of it as a traffic jam caused by too many people on one roadway. Let\u2019s take a look at where Ivacy\u2019s servers are located: The US Canada Panama Costa Rica Mexico Kenya Chile Brazil Peru Colombia United Kingdom NZ Germany Netherlands Sweden Romania Switzerland Seychelles Luxembourg France Italy Bulgaria Poland Nigeria Czech Republic Belgium Denmark Norway Spain Ghana Latvia Ukraine Finland Austria Turkey Egypt Hong Kong Indonesia Taiwan South Korea Japan Australia Jordan Philippines Brunei India United Arab Emirates South Africa Sadi Arabia Pakistan Russia Malaysia Singapore About 25% of Ivacy\u2019s servers are virtual. Ivacy hasn&#039;t always been upfront about its use of virtual servers. For example, its Venezuelan and Saudi Arabian servers are actually in Miami, Florida. Ivacy also doesn\u2019t disclose the number of IP addresses it assigns. On the plus side, I was impressed to see it has servers in countries that many VPNs don&#039;t \u2014 like Panama, Kenya, Ghana, and Costa Rica. Looking at the app, the \u201cSmart Connect\u201d feature is the first thing you see. This feature routes you to the best local server. With one tap on the screen, I was connected in seconds. I then tested servers in the UK , France , Nigeria, and Costa Rica. I am based in the US, and anything overseas was very slow and inconsistent. The UK server took about a minute to connect, and had a connection drop on my first attempt. France took about 10 seconds to make a connection. Nigeria connected almost instantly, and Costa Rica took about 30 seconds. I then took a look at the app\u2019s specialized servers; you can find them under the \u2018Purposes\u2019 tab. Smart Streaming servers can unblock streaming sites. Secure Downloading servers are optimized for P2P. Start Unblocking servers are optimized for accessing blocked web pages (like social media). The catch to the latter two is that they don\u2019t tell you the best server to use, so you have to experiment to find your best choice, which is a bit of a hassle. Try Ivacy\u2019s Servers Today! Security \u2014 Locked Down Ivacy offers 256-bit encryption. This is what all premium VPNs use to encrypt your data. Everything is encrypted to shield your information from potential hackers, whether you&#039;re streaming, downloading, or browsing. You are anonymous and hidden when you use Ivacy. Ivacy prevents ISP monitoring, so your location and your online activity are always hidden. There are several security protocol options, such as: IKEv2\/ IPSec, L2TP\/IPSec, OpenVPN (TCP and UDP), PPTP, and SSTP. You can choose which security protocol best suits your needs, however, not all devices have the same protocol options. For instance, I was only able to select OpenVPN protocols on my Android. OpenVPN is only available in 17 countries and WireGuard is not supported at this time. I noticed that you have to disconnect your current VPN connection to switch protocols. It also offers DNS, IPV6, and WebRTC leak protection, along with first-party DNS and a kill switch. All of which help you keep your actual IP address hidden. The security features are easily accessible on the app under the left side toolbar. I first took a look at the split tunneling feature. Once you open that tab, it directs you to a page where you can turn on the feature. Once the split tunneling feature is turned on, you are directed to a list of apps, where you can choose which ones you want to route through the VPN. The settings menu is easy to use This is an excellent feature to have so you can browse the web safely with the VPN in use while other apps can be used directly with your ISP. This is good for times when you need to connect to a printer or other device on your local network. Unfortunately, this feature is not available for Apple users, only Windows and Android. I had to enable the kill switch manually before connecting. Once connected, I couldn\u2019t turn the feature off (and likewise could not enable it while connected). When my connection dropped, the kill switch was activated and I got an error message sayingI was disconnected. I had to manually connect the VPN. The whole experience of testing was quite annoying and didn\u2019t go as smoothly as hoped. Ivacy\u2019s \u2018Secure Download\u2019 feature was probably the worst to test of all. This feature protects your device from viruses by scanning the document before downloading. It also has a malware blocker that detects harmful URLs and stops you from accessing them. Another red flag is Ivacy\u2019s zero encryption option. Encryption is vital because it protects your sensitive data from cybercriminals. It isn\u2019t safe to use a zero-encryption option, and it\u2019s shocking that a VPN company would even offer this. Ivacy says it offers a zero encryption option Protect Yourself With Ivacy! Privacy \u2014 Using Ivacy is Worry-Free Ivacy is upfront about their basic procedures and their relationships with third parties. Your browsing history, what you download, and IP address are not stored. Ivacy only collects data you consent to, so you know what is being processed. The only information you need to provide is asked of you upon registration. The website states that you can also ask for deletion of all your personal information. Ivacy is upfront about the data it collects Ivacy is based in Singapore, which is well-known for cooperating with the Five Eyes Alliance and easily hands over information. The Five Eyes Alliance is a surveillance network involving the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. While its zero logs policy means that it can\u2019t share your data with the Alliance, Ivacy has yet to go through a security audit. This is bad news because security audits make sure that VPNs are telling the truth about their security policies. To make this worse, Ivacy is secretive about its ownership, failing to provide any information to the public. Ivacy&#039;s Public Relations Manager went on record and even validated these claims by stating, &quot;There is no ethical obligation to reveal who the people behind Ivacy are.&quot; Why be so secretive? And do you want to trust a company that refuses to name its CEO? Ivacy&#039;s parent company is PGM Private Limited, the same parent company as PureVPN, which isn&#039;t an issue on the surface because this is a common occurrence for several competing businesses to be owned by one parent company. I contacted Ivacy\u2019s customer support to ask about ownership and if they have any ties to PureVPN due to speculation after Ivacy claimed they had a minor affiliation with their competitor. Unsurprisingly, I did not get a response. Do we want to trust a company that holds our privacy in their hands when they cannot even be upfront and honest about who they are and what is going on on the inside? Try Ivacy VPN Today! Torrenting \u2014 Good Choice in Theory In theory, Ivacy is a good choice for torrenting for Windows and Android users. Their zero-log policy keeps your information safe. Their kill switch protects you in case of a disconnection. Be mindful of the fact that macOS and iOS do not support the kill switch feature. Your safest option for using Ivacy for torrenting is to do so on Windows or Android devices. They have dedicated P2P servers that help lighten a load of popular servers to keep them from getting over-crowded, which, in turn, would slow down speeds. But if their speeds are terrible in the first place, does that really help? You have to be connected to one of these servers to be able to access P2P: Brunei Bulgaria Canada Costa Rica Denmark Germany Latvia Luxembourg Netherlands Pakistan Panama Russia Saudi Arabia Sweden Turkey United Kingdom Venezuela Be sure to check the rules and regulations for your country before torrenting. My team and I do not condone illegal torrenting. You can find Ivacy&#039;s dedicated servers for torrenting\/P2P under the &quot;Secure Download&quot; section of the app under the &quot;Purposes&quot; tab. Here, you are given a shortlist of P2P servers to choose from, but they don&#039;t give you any inclination of what server will be the best option for you, so it&#039;s a bit of a trial and error type of situation. Ivacy has many P2P-optimized servers In the testing process, the app froze several times , and was too slow for me to test this feature at all. Torrent With Ivacy VPN Today! Does Ivacy Work in China? No I contacted customer support and, according to them, Ivacy does not work in China. There is an app that\u2019s just for Chinese users (called Ivacy Prime). Oddy, they didn\u2019t give me any information about their app \u2014 and this app isn\u2019t advertised on their website, other than one installation guide. I later asked customer support about Ivacy Prime to see what information they would give me since they were vague about my other question. Customer support says it\u2019s hard to get a VPN to work in China I then decided to do some research, which was hard because Ivacy\u2019s website gives no information on the subject. Ivacy Prime is made specifically for Chinese users, but it is not equal to its original counterpart. This version is only available for Windows and Android users, as well. It doesn\u2019t cost extra; it\u2019s just a separate app. Ivacy Prime has fewer features \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have the kill switch feature or split tunneling. The kill switch is a significant feature that protects users in the case of connection drops, and by not having this feature, users put themselves at risk. Unlike the original app, Ivacy Prime only supports OpenVPN. OpenVPN is a good choice for this app, however, because of how secure it is. I attempted to test the Ivacy Prime app with no. Everything tells me this app is available for Android, but in my case, it was unavailable. It is nowhere to be found in the Google Play Store, but I found a setup guide on Ivacy\u2019s website via a Google search. I followed these instructions, but wasn\u2019t able to download the app due to this security message. I honestly didn\u2019t feel comfortable attempting to download by changing my phone settings because of the lack of information I could find about the app. So testing this section for this review was a flop, as well. I wasn\u2019t able to download the Ivacy Prime app Try Ivacy VPN Today! Simultaneous Device Connections \u2014 More Bang for Your Buck According to their customer service support, you can connect up to 10 devices simultaneously. Device Compatibility \u2014 Wide Variety of Devices, but Not All Created Equal Ivacy is compatible with: Android Apple TV macOS Edge Windows Firefox iOS Chrome Amazon Fire Stick Nintendo Chromecast PlayStation Kodi Xbox Linux Routers Some apps have extra features \u2014 for example, the kill switch isn\u2019t on macOS or iOS. So if you choose Ivacy, you run the risk of being exposed if your connection drops. When I was testing customer support, I asked if Ivacy is compatible with Roku (the same goes for Nintendo, PlayStation, and XBox). I was told I might need to configure the VPN through a router. To do this, you have to manually configure your router\u2019s settings. They offer browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, these extensions are only proxies. They don\u2019t provide you with full coverage security as the app does. The app is simple and a good tool for new users. I found it to be relatively easy to use, besides being vague about the purpose of certain sections. When you open the app, you\u2019ll see the \u201cSmart Connect\u201d feature. With a click on the grey power button in the middle of the screen, this turns on the VPN. When set to automatic, it connects you to your nearest server. To change your server location, tap underneath \u201cconnect to\u201d or the location tab on the top right-hand portion of the screen. Here, you can select your location of choice. There is also a search option, and you can look for servers in specific cities. The downside is that the app does not indicate which server is best. Ivacy\u2019s apps are easy to use The \u201cPurposes\u201d tab could use a little more explanation. This tab gives you 3 options: \u201cSmart Streaming\u201d, \u201cSecure Downloading\u201d, and \u201cStart Unblocking\u201d but doesn\u2019t go into detail about the purpose of each mode. By clicking the toolbar on the left side, you will find your kill switch, split tunneling, and security protocol options On the upper right-hand top of the screen, you will find a \u201cMore info\u201d button; this leads you to a FAQ and contact page. The desktop app is very different from the mobile app, with fewer features. The kill switch is easy to spot and is off by default. The &quot;Purposes&quot; tab is slightly different; the desktop version is labeled as &quot;Start Streaming&quot; and &quot;Internet Freedom (unblocking)&quot; and seems to be missing the &quot;Secure Downloads&quot; feature for dedicated torrenting and P2P servers that the mobile app provides. The mobile app is different to the desktop version The locations tab is similar to the mobile app, with a list of server locations, but still no help in finding the best server. Also, surprisingly, compared to the mobile app, there are far fewer setting options. The only options are the ability to bypass a proxy, a link under \u201cMembers Area\u201d that directs you to their webpage, an \u201cabout Ivacy\u201d section that also links you to their webpage, a link to their privacy policies, a webRTC leak protection switch, and a FAQ section. Where are all these features Ivacy brags about? Am I missing something? Try Ivacy On Your Device!",
